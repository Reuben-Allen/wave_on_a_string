# Wave on a String Simulation
This program will simulate the propagation of a 1D wave through a string under various conditions.
These include:
- Pulsed v.s. continuous wave
- Wave interference
- Two strings of different density
- Damped oscillation
- Option to plot energy
<a/>

Additionally, the spring constant and length of the string can be specified.  

This repository includes the Oscillator class which contains all the necessary functions.
To get started, simply run 
```
spring = Oscillator(length,k,resolution,mass_1,mass_2,damping)
``` 
where length is the length of the string in meters, k is the spring constant in newtons per meter, resolution is the number of points to simulate along the string, mass_1 and mass_2 are the masses of each half of the string, and damping is the damping coefficient. The animated plot can be generated by calling 
```
spring.animate(frequency,amplitude,time,fps,interference_frequency,interference_amplitude,pulse,plot_energy)
``` 
where frequency is the frequency of the oscillator in hertz, amplitude is the amplitude of the driver in meters, time is the time interval of the simulation in seconds, fps is the number of frames simulated per second. Optionally, similar parameters for an interfereing wave can be specified. Lastly, pulse and plot_energy can be set to True or False.
## Example
```
spring = Oscillator(10,20,1000,0.05,0.05,0)
spring.animate(0.05,0.9,time=150,fps=1,interference_frequency=0.1,interference_amplitude=0.3,pulse=False,plot_energy=False)
```
